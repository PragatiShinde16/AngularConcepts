<!-- * Routing :-
                - Navigate from one page to another page.
                - For that its necessary to doing three steps :-
                                1. Configure the route in app.routing.module.ts
                                2. Use <router-outlet> in any html file. here we used in app.component.html file.
                                3. Establish the link/navigate between the component.

     * <router-outlet> :- 
                    - It is a component directive.

     * routerLink :- 
                    - It is atribute directive. 
-->

<a routerLink="/Page1">Page1</a>
<!-- 
    - here we do property binding
    - syntax :-
            [routerLink] = "['pathName', propertyName]"
            - here on 0th index always take a path in string format and on 1st index take a property which we declare in ts file
            
    - Ex :-
            [routerLink]="['/Page2', myid]"
-->
<a [routerLink]="['/Page2', myid]">Page2</a>
<a routerLink="/Follower">Follower</a>
